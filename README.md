# Terraform + AWS Infrastructure Project

This project provides a complete AWS infrastructure using Terraform. It automates the deployment of a scalable and secure web application environment across public and private subnets using key AWS services.

---

## Architecture Overview

- ‚úÖ **VPC** with public and private subnets across multiple Availability Zones.
- ‚úÖ **Internet Gateway** for public subnet internet access.
- ‚úÖ **NAT Gateway** to allow outbound access for private instances.
- ‚úÖ **Application Load Balancer (ALB)** in public subnets.
- ‚úÖ **Auto Scaling Group (ASG)** launching EC2 instances in private subnets.
- ‚úÖ **Security Groups** to control traffic between Bastion, ALB, and EC2 instances.
- ‚úÖ **User data script** installs and runs Nginx on EC2 instances.
- ‚úÖ **Target Group + Health Checks** integrated with ALB to route traffic to healthy EC2s.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Deploy

> üìù Make sure you have AWS CLI configured and Terraform installed.

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name

2. **Initialize Terraform**
   ```bash
   terraform init

3. **Validate the Configuration**
   ```bash
   terraform validate

4. **Review the Execution Plan**
   ```bash
   terraform plan

4. **Apply the Infrastructure**
   ```bash
   terraform apply

6. **Verify Deployment**

   After a few minutes, open the Application Load Balancer DNS in your browser:
   http://<your-alb-dns-name>
   You should see the Nginx "Hello World" page.

‚úÖ **Pre-requisites**

    - AWS account

    - IAM user with necessary permissions

    - AWS CLI configured

    - SSH key pair (if needed for Bastion access)

## How to Deploy

> Make sure you have AWS CLI configured and Terraform installed.

1. **Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shravani3001/terraform-web-infra.git
cd terraform-web-infra
```

2. **Generate SSH Key Pair**
```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -f web-infra-key
```

This generates web-infra-key and web-infra-key.pub

3. **Initialize Terraform**
```bash
terraform init
```

4. **Validate the Configuration**
```bash
terraform validate
```

5. **Preview the Execution Plan**
```bash
terraform plan
```

6. **Apply the Infrastructure**
```bash
terraform apply
```

7. **Verify Deployment**
After a few minutes, open the Application Load Balancer DNS in your browser:
http://<your-alb-dns-name>
You should see the Nginx "Hello World" page.

**Notes**
The infrastructure is deployed in us-east-1 (you can update the region if needed).
EC2 instances in private subnets are automatically launched via Auto Scaling Group with user data to install Nginx.
No manual SSH is required when using ASG (unless debugging).
Ensure ALB and EC2 instance subnets are in enabled Availability Zones.
    
8. **To tear down everything**
```bash
terraform destroy
```
